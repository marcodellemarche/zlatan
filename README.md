# zlatan

> Status: **v0.10.0** (2026-10-06). The service runs, the schema is applied, the wizard renders and gates access; the Google OAuth flow, the Nextcloud Login Flow (per-person app password), the runner that drives `rclone` straight into Nextcloud over WebDAV, the runner that drives `immich-go`, the resumable Takeout upload and the watcher that collects a Takeout from the person's own Drive all work. A finished copy is now **verified** (whole tree by size, a sample byte for byte), **notified** over ntfy, and its staging is **purged** on a retention clock; before the copy Zlatan reads the source size and the person's Nextcloud usage and **warns** if the copy would exceed their budget. The image is published at `ghcr.io/marcodellemarche/zlatan`. Each person connects their own Immich API key, so their photos land in their own account, and the wizard links them to the public address of each cloud, never the internal Docker one. A migration a restart left mid-flight is put back to a state the person can restart, rather than spinning forever. The wizard picks the Photos route from Google's own free space, and the upload resumes by content, so an interruption costs only what was not sent. For a split export the person declares how many files Google made, chooses whether the import auto-starts once they are all here, and either uploads the zips or lets the kiosk browser download them onto the NAS. `/about`, `/privacy` and `/terms` are readable without signing in, which is what Google's OAuth verification requires.

zlatan is a self-guided migration service for self-hosted stacks. A person who is not technical (a family member, a friend) opens it in a browser, signs in with the household single sign-on, and is walked through moving their data off Google: **Google Drive → Nextcloud** and **Google Photos → Immich**. The operator configures it once and is not in the loop for every person.

## The constraint that defines the service

**Drive can be automated end to end. Photos cannot.** On 2025-03-31 Google removed the read scopes of the Photos Library API, and there is no API to start a Takeout (`takeout.google.com` is not programmable; the Data Portability API covers only Chrome, Maps, Play, Search, Shopping and YouTube). So the Photos route always contains **one human click**: the wizard guides that person, works out on its own when the export is ready, and does everything else. This is not a limit that more code can remove: it is Google.

## How it is built

A single Go binary (`zlatan`), inside a container that also holds `rclone` and `immich-go`. SQLite for the state: a migration lasts hours or days and cannot live inside an HTTP request.

```

└── web/        the wizard: routes, authentication, templates
```

Two independent tracks, `drive` and `photos`: a person may run one, the other, or both in parallel. The state of one never touches the other.

## How the Photos half collects a Takeout

Google cannot be asked for a Takeout by a program, so the person asks for it once. There are two routes, and the wizard picks the one that can work: **"Add to Drive"** writes the export into the person's own Drive, which needs room in Google's own storage for the whole export. Google does not say how large Photos is, so the wizard measures the free space against everything outside Drive (Photos plus Gmail), and when it does not fit it says so and offers the upload instead. That is not an edge case: the person whose Drive is full of the photos they are moving is exactly the one who needs the upload.

**Add to Drive.** The export lands in their own Drive, under a folder Google names `Takeout`. Zlatan already holds a `drive.readonly` token for that account from the Drive half, so a watcher simply looks for the folder: when it appears, and only once every part Google listed is present and non-empty, it downloads the parts and imports them with `immich-go`.

**Upload.** The person downloads the export and sends it in chunks from the browser. The upload resumes: the file's SHA-256 is announced first, so the server recognises the same content even when Google renames a re-downloaded archive, sends back what is still missing, and the browser sends only that. The browser shows how far it has read while it hashes, and remembers the hash, so a resume does not read the file again. A chunk that drops is retried with a timeout and a backoff rather than freezing the page, and a chunk that arrived short is treated as missing rather than counted.

Nothing is shared with anybody: there is no central Google account and no folder-sharing step. The Drive copy excludes the `Takeout` folder, so the archive does not also land in Nextcloud as files: the photos belong in Immich and the archive is disposable. A wait that outlives `ZLATAN_TAKEOUT_MAX_WAIT` ends with a pointer to the upload route, rather than a screen that never moves.

## How the Drive half reaches Nextcloud

rclone copies Google Drive **straight into the person's Nextcloud over WebDAV**, so there is no local staging for the Drive half and no second import step. The write credential is a per-user **app password obtained through Nextcloud's Login Flow v2**: the person clicks "Grant access" once, behind the same SSO, and Zlatan receives a credential with exactly that person's rights.

This was chosen over the alternatives on purpose. The Nextcloud admin over WebDAV can *read* another person's files but cannot *write* into their space (MKCOL answers 403), so an admin-driven import does not work. The direct filesystem route (write into the data directory and run `occ files:scan`) would need the Docker socket (root-equivalent access on the host) and a coupling to Nextcloud's internal layout. The Login Flow needs neither: only public APIs, and no standing privilege beyond what each person already has.

## Security

The service **holds the Google OAuth refresh token of every person who uses it**, and each one grants read access to that person's entire Drive. It also holds each person's Nextcloud app password. They are the most sensitive secrets in the homelab.

- **Tokens are encrypted at rest** (AES-GCM). The key (`ZLATAN_TOKEN_KEY`) lives only in the environment; the database holds ciphertext.
- **A credential is kept only while a track can use it.** Drive done: the Nextcloud app password is deleted in Nextcloud and forgotten. Photos done: the Immich key is forgotten (Immich cannot revoke a key without its id, so the person deletes it there). Both done: the Google grant is revoked at Google and forgotten. A migration idle for the retention period with no work in flight loses all of them, which covers whoever moves only one half or stops halfway. A failed track keeps its credentials, so a retry needs no reconnect.
- **The identity comes only from the forward-auth header** (`Remote-User`), and is believed only when the request arrives from the configured proxy network. Never from a URL parameter or a cookie: a person can only ever see their own migration, by construction.
- **A secret shared with the proxy** (`X-Zlatan-Proxy-Secret`): a container on the same Docker network cannot reach the service directly and skip the SSO.
- **A public bind without a secret is refused at startup**, not accepted silently.
- **The public pages carry no data.** They are outside the SSO but still behind the proxy secret, and since the identity comes only from the forward-auth header, every other route answers an anonymous request with an empty page anyway.

## Configuration

See `.env.example`. The required variables are `ZLATAN_TRUSTED_PROXY`, `ZLATAN_TOKEN_KEY` and, if the bind is public, `ZLATAN_PROXY_SECRET`.

### The Google OAuth client's publishing status

`drive.readonly` is a *restricted* scope, and the publishing status of the OAuth consent screen decides how long a person's token lives:

- **Testing**: only the test users listed in the console can sign in, and Google expires their refresh tokens after 7 days. A Takeout wait (`ZLATAN_TAKEOUT_MAX_WAIT` is 7 days by default) or a large copy can outlive the token, and the person is sent back to connect Google again.
- **In production, unverified**: anyone can sign in, behind a "Google hasn't verified this app" warning, up to 100 users, and the tokens do not expire on a clock. For one household this is the practical choice.
- **Verified**: no warning, but a restricted scope needs a third-party security assessment (CASA) on top of the public pages and the review, renewed every year.

## Features

- [x] Per-person Google OAuth (`drive.readonly`), tokens sealed in the store.
- [x] A `Runner` that drives `rclone` for Drive → Nextcloud, with progress.
- [x] A `Runner` that drives `immich-go` for the Takeout → Immich.
- [x] Split Takeouts on the upload route: the person declares how many files Google gave them (nothing inside the archives says so) and sends them together or over several days; the import runs once every declared part is on disk. Google's part numbers name the missing part and catch a count that is too low.
- [x] How the import starts is the person's choice: a checkbox, off by default, starts it on its own once every part is here; otherwise they press Start. With it on, a server-side sweep starts it even with the tab closed, so a download that finishes after the browser is gone still imports. The browser never starts anything itself — it polls and shows the state, so an import begun by the sweep appears on the next poll like any other.
- [x] A second route for the files: besides sending the zips through the browser, the wizard links to the kiosk service (`ZLATAN_KIOSK_URL`), a throwaway browser on the NAS that downloads the Takeout straight into staging, at gigabit and with the PC off. The files land in the same place, so the import treats both routes identically; the two can even be mixed.
- [x] Resumable Takeout upload (route B), keyed by the file's SHA-256: the same content resumes under a different name, different content under the same name replaces an unfinished upload and is stored beside a finished one, a truncated chunk counts as missing, and the file is checked against the announced hash before it is imported. Chunks are written in place and hashed as they arrive, so finishing is a rename rather than a pass over the whole archive, and a mismatch discards the chunks so the next attempt sends the file again.
- [x] Import into Nextcloud: rclone copies Drive straight to WebDAV, with a per-person app password from the Nextcloud Login Flow v2.
- [x] The "Add to Drive" route: a watcher looks for the Takeout folder in the person's own Drive (with the token it already holds), waits until every part is non-empty, the numbering has no gap and the listing has not changed since the previous look, downloads it and imports it. No folder to share and no central account.
- [x] Verification: the whole tree by size, plus a random sample compared byte for byte (Drive exposes MD5, Nextcloud SHA1, so no shared hash exists and the sample is downloaded). The check excludes exactly what the copy excludes (the `Takeout` folder on the "Add to Drive" route), so a folder deliberately left behind is never reported as missing. Native Google documents are excluded from the byte sample and compared by size only: rclone *exports* them on the fly and that export is not reproducible, so a byte comparison would report a difference that is not there and stop an intact migration. Photos are checked through `immich-go`'s own report, which hashes each asset against the server.
- [x] Staging purge: a finished migration's staging is removed after the configured retention, swept from the database so a directory nobody owns is never touched.
- [x] Notifications over ntfy on completion and on failure.
- [x] Quotas: the warning (source size + current Nextcloud usage against the budget) is implemented.
- [x] The space at Google: the wizard states how much space the person's data takes up at Google, so the size of what is being moved is visible. Drive is exact (rclone size); Photos is an upper bound, because Google reports it only inside "other" (Gmail plus Photos) and never on its own, and the phrase says so.
- [x] A per-person Immich API key. Immich has no admin endpoint that mints a key for another account, so the person creates their own in Immich and pastes it into the wizard; Zlatan validates it against `/api/users/me`, shows whose account it is, and seals it per person. The import runs as them, so photos land in their own library and no shared key exists to misfile anyone.
- [x] Recovery after a restart: a track left copying, verifying, downloading or importing is put back to a restartable state at startup. The work is not resumed on its own, and restarting it is safe because rclone and immich-go skip what is already there.
- [x] Public pages: `/about`, `/privacy` and `/terms`, in English and Italian, readable without an identity. Google will not verify an app whose privacy policy sits behind a login, and rejects a home page that is only a login screen. The policy renders the scope from the same constant the OAuth client asks with, so it cannot drift from the request. Caddy serves these four paths, plus `/static`, outside the SSO.

The full design lives in the homelab repository, `docs/zlatan-service.md`.
